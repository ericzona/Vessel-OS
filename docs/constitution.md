# Vessel-OS Constitution v1.0

**The Great Transit - Pioneer DAO Governance Framework**

---

## Preamble

We, the Pioneers of The Great Transit, establish this Constitution to govern our journey through the void. This document defines the principles, economics, and rights of all participants in the Vessel-OS ecosystem.

---

## Article I: The Mission

**The Great Transit** is a multi-generational journey to establish a new civilization in a distant Galaxy. All systems, mechanics, and governance structures serve this singular purpose: *survival and arrival*.

### Section 1.1: Core Principles

1. **Transparency** - All game mechanics are documented and verifiable
2. **Fairness** - No hidden advantages; skill and strategy determine success
3. **Community** - Players are co-Pioneers, not competitors
4. **Sustainability** - Economic systems designed for long-term viability
5. **Legacy** - Early participants are honored in perpetuity

---

## Article II: The $SCRAP Economy

### Section 2.1: $SCRAP Token Definition

**$SCRAP** is the native resource token of The Great Transit. It represents salvaged materials, refined from the void itself, used to maintain and repair the Pioneer vessels.

**Properties:**
- **Type:** Fungible utility token (future: SPL token on Solana)
- **Supply:** Generated through mining (player action)
- **Utility:** Required for ship repairs, upgrades, and crafting
- **Transferability:** Tradeable between players (future implementation)

### Section 2.2: Mining Rights

All Pioneers have the right to mine the void for $SCRAP. Mining is achieved through:
- Time investment (subjective time units)
- Skill-based mechanics (future: mini-games, puzzles)
- Exploration of anomalies (random events)

**Yield:** 1-5 $SCRAP per mining action  
**Cost:** 20 subjective time units  

### Section 2.3: Economic Balance

The $SCRAP economy is designed with:
- **Burn Mechanism:** Repairs consume $SCRAP permanently
- **Earn Mechanism:** Mining generates new $SCRAP
- **Scarcity:** Limited mining actions per time period (via subjective time)
- **Shadow Ledger:** All in-game transactions tracked for future token migration

---

## Article III: The Right of Return

### Section 3.1: Legacy Holder Protection

**Definition:** Legacy Holders are players who participated in the alpha/beta phases before token launch.

**Rights Guaranteed:**
1. **Airdrop Priority** - Legacy holders receive proportional $SCRAP tokens upon mainnet launch
2. **Founder NFTs** - Special "Pioneer Badge" NFTs granted to early participants
3. **Governance Weight** - Legacy holders receive enhanced voting power in Pioneer DAO decisions
4. **Cosmetic Recognition** - Unique in-game visual markers (ship skins, badges)

### Section 3.2: Retroactive Distribution

Upon token launch, the Shadow Ledger (in-game activity log) will be analyzed to determine:
- Total $SCRAP earned through gameplay
- Total $SCRAP spent on repairs/upgrades
- Net contribution to community (helping other players)
- Time invested (total gameplay hours)

**Formula:** `Airdrop Amount = (Earned - Spent) × 1.5 + (Hours Played ÷ 10)`

This ensures early players who invested time are rewarded fairly.

---

## Article IV: Pioneer DAO Governance

### Section 4.1: Structure

The **Pioneer DAO** is the decentralized governance body for The Great Transit ecosystem.

**Powers:**
- Approve game mechanics changes
- Adjust economic parameters ($SCRAP burn/earn rates)
- Vote on story/mission additions
- Allocate treasury funds for development
- Determine partnerships and integrations

### Section 4.2: Voting Rights

**One Token, One Vote** - Each $SCRAP token = 1 vote  
**Weighted for Legacy** - Legacy holders receive 2x voting power  
**Quadratic Voting** - Optional: reduces whale influence  

### Section 4.3: Proposal Process

1. **Proposal Submission** - Any holder with 1000+ $SCRAP can submit
2. **Discussion Period** - 7 days for community review
3. **Voting Period** - 3 days for yes/no vote
4. **Execution** - 51% majority required for passage
5. **Implementation** - Dev team executes within 30 days

---

## Article V: The Shadow Ledger

### Section 5.1: Purpose

The **Shadow Ledger** is an in-game database tracking all economic activity before token launch. This ensures:
- Fair distribution when $SCRAP becomes a blockchain token
- Audit trail for airdrop calculations
- Community transparency
- Anti-exploit measures

### Section 5.2: Tracked Metrics

- Player ID (wallet address, future integration)
- $SCRAP mined (total accumulated)
- $SCRAP spent (total consumed)
- Repairs performed
- Ship upgrades purchased
- Items crafted
- Trades with other players (future)
- Time played (total hours)

### Section 5.3: Privacy & Security

- Shadow Ledger data encrypted at rest
- Personal identifiers (future wallet addresses) hashed
- Aggregate data published monthly for transparency
- Individual balances viewable only by player

---

## Article VI: Economic Sustainability

### Section 6.1: Deflationary Design

The Great Transit economy is **deflationary by design**:
- Ship systems degrade constantly (creates demand)
- Repairs burn $SCRAP permanently (reduces supply)
- Mining has time cost (limits generation rate)
- No infinite $SCRAP exploits (audited mechanics)

### Section 6.2: Treasury Allocation

Upon token launch, a **Community Treasury** will be established:
- 10% of initial token supply
- Controlled by Pioneer DAO votes
- Used for: development bounties, marketing, partnerships
- Transparent multi-sig wallet (future: on-chain)

---

## Article VII: Player Rights

### Section 7.1: Freedom of Play

All Pioneers have the right to:
- Play at their own pace (no forced time pressure)
- Choose their strategy (mining vs. trading vs. exploration)
- Exit the game at any time with full $SCRAP balance intact
- Sell or trade their $SCRAP (future: DEX integration)

### Section 7.2: Anti-Exploitation

Players are protected against:
- Developer rug-pulls (community-controlled treasury)
- Pay-to-win mechanics (no real-money $SCRAP purchases)
- Unfair advantages (no premium features behind paywalls)
- Account theft (security best practices enforced)

---

## Article VIII: Amendments

This Constitution can be amended through:
1. Pioneer DAO proposal (as per Article IV)
2. 66% supermajority vote required
3. 14-day discussion + voting period
4. Automatic implementation upon passage

**Immutable Principles:**
- The Right of Return (Article III) cannot be revoked
- Economic transparency (Article V) cannot be removed
- Player rights (Article VII) cannot be diminished

---

## Article IX: Dissolution Clause

If The Great Transit project must end:
1. All Shadow Ledger data released to community
2. $SCRAP token ownership transferred to Pioneer DAO
3. Source code open-sourced under MIT license
4. Community may fork and continue independently

**Developer Commitment:** The core team will never abandon the project without community transition.
